Google's tools for working with FHIR data in Python. This includes:

* Support for converting FHIR data to and from an efficient Protocol Buffer-based format.
* Support for creating and analyzing views over large FHIR datasets. See the [Google FHIR Views](google-fhir-views/README.md) documentation and [notebook examples](examples) for details.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

# Installation

__Note: Requires Python >= `3.8`.__

These libraries are installed via pip.

## From PyPi

Users interested in FHIR Views and the underlying libraries can simply run the
following to install the views library, BigQuery, Spark and FHIR R4 dependencies:

```
pip install google-fhir-views[r4,bigquery,spark]
```

Users who only need the BigQuery or Spark runners can run:

```
pip install google-fhir-views[r4,bigquery]
```

or

```
pip install google-fhir-views[r4,spark]
```
respectively, to reduce the installation size.

Note: If installing for use in a Jupyter notebook, it's best `pip install ...` _before_ starting the notebook kernel to avoid dependency version issues.

Users looking for only the underlying FHIR Protocol Buffer support can
run `pip install google-fhir-r4` to retrieve only that and its dependencies.

## From source code
This can be installed locally, directly from source by running the following
commands in this directory. As always, doing so within a Python virtual
environment is recommended.

### protoc installation prerequisite
This library generates Protocol Buffers for FHIR resources, so the protoc
executable must be available. This can be done on Linux by running:

```
apt install protobuf-compiler
protoc --version # Ensure version 3+
```

Or on MacOS with Homebrew:

```
brew install protobuf
protoc --version # Ensure version 3+
```

Windows users can download protoc releases [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).

### pip installation
Once protoc is available, the fhir-py libraries can be installed from source by
running the following in the fhir-py directory:

```
pip install ./google-fhir-core[bigquery,spark]
pip install ./google-fhir-r4
pip install ./google-fhir-views[r4,bigquery,spark]
```

See the [Google FHIR Views](google-fhir-views/README.md) documentation for
details on use.
